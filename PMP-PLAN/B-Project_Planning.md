# PROJECT OVERVIEW
## B. PLANNING THE PROJECT

### Project Management Life cycle

The project management life cycle is represented and documented in the form of a Gantt Chart, which allows staff to follow guidelines and meet milestones on a regular basis. The project life cycle divides the tasks and work of each member, such as the project manager, into several modules. Based on the Work Breakdown Structure constructed, each member has their own roles and parts in each stage of the lifecycle.
Work Breakdown Structure is shown in the Gantt Chart below:

The Work Breakdown Structure for the Image Colorization Project is shown below. This work breakdown structure is designed to divide the project's technical components into several modules such as interface design, API management, Image Detection and Colorization System:

### Scope
A work breakdown structure (WBS) is created to map out all of the necessary tasks and to develop the process that will be maintained and approved for the WBS.

In this image colorization project, we need to identify the scope of the project. For instance, the project will not accept car plate number that are unique as it does not follow the government rules. For example, the car plate number is reflecting to lights and car plate number with special fonts will not be acceptable. Besides, this project scope down the limit of the project by only detect alphabet and number character. Therefore, country such as Japan and Thailand might not be able to use this system.

### Risk Identification Chart (Quality, Cost, Time)

| Control Element | What is likely to go wrong? | How and when will I know? | What will I do about it? |
|-----|----|-------|-----|
|Quality <br> (Poor attitude toward quality; substandard design, materials, and workmanship; inadequate quality assurance program)|1. Inadequate Quality Assurance Program: The system confused with car plate number recognition <br> (Ex. digit 0 and letter o) <br><br> 2. Inadequate Quality Assurance Program: The quality of the AI model is biased towards a certain design of the car plate.  |How: The output result always segmented the wrong part of the car plate <br> <br> When: The quality problem of will be determined during the unit testing phase|Assign one member to keep on collecting the data day to day and increased the dataset until a satisfied result is determined.|
|Cost <br> (Estimating errors; inadequate productivity, cost, change, or contingency)|1. Contigency: The costing of the server will be spike if one of the developer forget to shutdown the EC2 instance when not using it. <br><br> 2. Inadequate productivity: Team members are affected by covid-19 and unable to deliver what they suppoosed to deliver which lead to extra cost need to allocated for the cloud servers. |How: The monthly bills shows unexpected extra charged to the bills.<br><br>When: The problem most probably will be encountered during the project execution and project implementation.|Notify the owner through email or discord whenever budget exceed threshold in the AWS cloud computing service.
|Time <br> (Errors in estimating time or resource availability; errors in determining the critical path; poor allocation and management of float; early release of competitive products) | 1. Project not able to reach the milestone set  as described in the Gantt Chart. <br><br> 2. Erros in estimating resource availability: There are not enough server to be used to run the car plate recognition model training  |How: The members are stuck with a certain problem and drag all the other team members <br><br> When: The problem will be encountered during the project excution and monitoring phase.| Ask support from the other team member and switch their task or job to other job to avoid him/her to stuck in the problem loop.|
